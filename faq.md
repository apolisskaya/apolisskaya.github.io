## Things I'm commonly asked about

 - **What if I prefer talking and finding these things out for myself?**
 
 Not a problem at all. This information is here for convenience rather than to eliminate conversation. Feel free to contact me if you'd like to connect or have any questions for me, whether or not they're been answered here.
 
 
- **What is your professional background?**

I have been working as a software engineer since February 2017 and have focused primarily on back-end work for the entirety of my career. Python has always been my most comfortable language, though I can work with a variety of others. I do not have a wealth of front-end development or web design experience, nor am I terribly interested in shifting in that direction.

I enjoy, and am good at, writing maintainable and readable code that accomplishes business-related logic and data processing as efficiently as possible. This includes everything from optimizing interactions with the database to improving execution speed of business logic.

I promise to do everything in my power to avoid causing downtime on prod.

In terms of specific companies I've worked at, they have ranged from 4-person teams to mega-corporations. I am comfortable in an Agile environment and work well with both in-house and distributed teams.

Long term, my goal is to shift from software engineering into a data engineering/data science role. This isn't set in stone, and I am more interested in the type of work I get to do than the title associated with that work.


- **What kind of education do you have?**

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science from Florida Atlantic University in January 2019. My last few semesters were remote because I was working as a full-time software engineer at Cisco while completing them.

As a mathematics major, I focused heavily on applied mathematics, programming and algorithm design.


- **Are you able to recite `<insert algorithm name here>` from your `<insert upper-level math course name here>` course over coffee?**

Not unless you give me advance notice to brush up on the topic. I'm more concerned with understanding how algorithms work and finding ways to optimize them than rote memorization. I would, however, love to discuss how said algorithm can be applied to all sorts of real-world problems.


- **Are you available for unpaid projects?**

Only if I'm genuinely excited about the project and want to contribute. If so, I make no guarantees regarding the number of hours I can budget for that work, nor my availability to answer questions. My full-time job always comes before side projects.


- **What about paid freelance work?**

Let's chat about it. I want to make sure that I'm the right person for the job before accepting money from a client.


- **Can you give me a referral to the company you're currently working for?** 

If we have worked together in the past in any capacity where I have seen your abilities at the role you're applying for, and I can vouch for you being at least an above-average candidate, yes.

Otherwise, I don't do referrals, but I'd be happy to answer your questions about what the job is like and I may be open to connecting you with a hiring manager (at their discretion).


- **Why did you leave `<company name here>`**?

For one reason or other, the role wasn't going to work for me going forward. I have nothing negative to say about any former employers and am grateful for the opportunities they provided. If you have more specific questions about a particular company, feel free to contact me.


- **Your duration at some of the roles on your resume is low. If I hire you, can I count on you sticking around for a while?**

Yes, as long as it is a mutually good fit. Reasons I might not consider it a good fit on my end include lack of room for growth, toxic culture, and the role not being what was advertised when I accepted the position. For example, if I accept a position as a Software Engineer and, once I get there, I find out the role is more like QA, it probably won't fit my long-term goals.


- **Are you only interested in full-time roles, or are you open to contracts?**

I prefer full-time roles but am open to contracts, especially if I have a strong interest in the project/role/company in question.


- **Your resume shows you working at Cisco in NC and I-SENSE in FL with overlap in time. What happened there?**

I relocated to NC in May of 2018 and worked full-time as a software engineer at Cisco while still working for I-SENSE on a part-time basis, remotely. My resume also shows that I actually worked for Cisco since April 2018; my first two weeks as a Cisco employee were remote from FL while I was finishing up my final in-person semester of college.


- **Are you interested in mentoring students or self-taught developers of any age?**

Sure! Reach out and let me know what you're looking for and we can go from there.


- **What is the best way to reach you?**

I get too many phone calls to answer them all, especially during work hours. If this is a first introduction, e-mail is your best bet.

You can reach me at *apolisskaya@gmail.com*

Once we connect, if you'd prefer, we can swap numbers and text/call as needed.
